O'Bhagavad Gita, with which Partha was illumined by Lord Narayana Himself, and which was composed within the Mahabharata by the ancient sage, Vyasa, O'Divine Mother, the destroyer   of  rebirth, the  showerer   of  the  nectar  of  Advaita,   and   consisting  of  eighteen discourses—upon Thee, O'Gita, O'Affectionate Mother, I meditate!
