May this lotus of the Mahabharata, born in the lake of the words of Vyasa, sweet with the  fragrance  of  the  meaning  of  the  Gita, with  many  stories  as  its  stamens,  fully  opened  by  the discourses of Hari, the destroyer of the sins of Kali, and drunk joyously by the bees of good men in the world, become day by day the bestower of good to us!
